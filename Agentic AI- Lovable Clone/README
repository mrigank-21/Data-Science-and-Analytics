🛠️ Coder Buddy
Coder Buddy is an AI-powered coding assistant built with LangGraph. It works like a multi-agent development team that can take a natural language request and transform it into a complete, working project — file by file — using real developer workflows.

🏛️ Architecture
Our agentic workflow is built on a clear, multi-step process that ensures high-quality output. Each agent has a specific role, turning a simple prompt into a fully realized application.

Planner Agent – Analyzes your request and generates a detailed project plan.

Architect Agent – Breaks down the plan into specific engineering tasks with explicit context for the coder.

Coder Agent – Implements each task, writes directly into files, and uses available tools to build the project.

✨ Key Features
Autonomous Web App Generation: Takes a high-level prompt and generates a complete, functional project.

Powered by Gemini: Integrates with Google's Gemini API for state-of-the-art reasoning and code generation.

Generates Complete Projects: Outputs a full project directory with well-structured HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a README.md file.
