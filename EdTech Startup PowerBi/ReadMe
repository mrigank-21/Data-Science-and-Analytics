EdTech Course Analysis Dashboard using Power BI
(Note: Replace this image with a high-quality screenshot of your final dashboard)

üöÄ Project Overview
This project involves the development of an end-to-end business intelligence solution for a fictional EdTech startup. The goal is to analyze a comprehensive dataset of online courses to uncover actionable insights that can drive business growth, guide content strategy, and support data-driven decision-making.

The entire project was built in Power BI, following the complete BI lifecycle: data cleaning and transformation, data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design and deployment.

üéØ Key Business Questions Addressed
The dashboard was designed to answer the following critical questions for the EdTech startup:

Course Distribution: What is the distribution of course types (e.g., Specialization, Certificate) across different categories?

Viewer Engagement: What are the average viewership numbers for each category, sub-category, and language?

In-Demand Skills: What are the most commonly taught skills in the current market?

Language Landscape: In which languages are most courses created, and which languages do viewers in top categories prefer?

Subtitle Impact: Is there a relationship between the availability of subtitles and course viewership?

Top Instructors: Who are the top 3 rated instructors for each category and sub-category?

Duration vs. Views: How does the length of a course influence viewer engagement?

Skill Variety: Does offering a wider variety of skills in a course impact its viewership?

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills & Tools Used
BI Tools: Power BI Desktop, Power BI Service

Core Languages: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), M Language (Power Query)

Data Skills:

Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL)

Data Modeling (Relational Star Schema)

Data Visualization & Dashboard Design

Requirements Analysis & Logic Building

Key Visuals: Slicers, Matrix, Stacked Charts, Line Charts, Drill-Down Charts, Word Cloud (Custom Visual)

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
Data Cleaning and Transformation (ETL):

Connected to the raw dataset and performed extensive data cleaning in the Power Query Editor.

Removed duplicate, blank, and error-filled rows to ensure data integrity.

Engineered custom columns using M Language to parse and count comma-separated values (e.g., number of skills, subtitles).

Executed an advanced unpivot transformation on instructor data to normalize the dataset, enabling accurate individual instructor analysis.

Data Modeling:

Created a relational data model with proper relationships between the primary fact table and newly created dimension tables (e.g., a separate, unpivoted Instructors table).

DAX Calculations:

Authored over 10 complex DAX measures to perform sophisticated analysis.

Key measures include a RANKX function to dynamically identify and filter for the top 5 course categories by average viewership and another to rank the top 3 instructors by rating.

Dashboard Design & Visualization:

Designed a multi-page interactive dashboard with a focus on user experience and a clear, category-wise analytical flow.

Implemented slicers and drill-down functionality to allow stakeholders to explore data from a high-level overview down to granular details.

Deployment:

Published the final report to Power BI Service and generated a shareable web link for seamless stakeholder access.

üìä Key Insights & Findings
Subtitle Impact: A clear positive correlation was found between the number of subtitle languages and viewer engagement. Courses with 15+ subtitles had significantly higher viewership.

Top Skills: The Word Cloud analysis confirmed that skills like Data Analysis and Python Programming are highly prevalent and in-demand across categories.

Top Instructors: The dashboard successfully identifies a dynamic list of top-rated instructors for any given category, providing a direct pipeline for potential talent acquisition.
